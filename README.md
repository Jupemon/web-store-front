## View Project : https://jupemon.github.io/web-store-front-manage/

## Info
This is the managing part of the online store i created on, it is connected to the server which is running on heroku. Editing products will change their data in the database.

## Please read!
Adding new products feature currently only works locally becouse heroku doesnt allow direct image file uploading. (I wish i would have know this... oh well) In order to enable product uploading you would have to attach some kind of external service where all the images get uploaded (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) And i dont think i will be adding anything else to the project.
